Credit for the main function of unliking posts goes to Ian Thompson (https://gist.github.com/ianathompson) from https://gist.github.com/aymericbeaumet/d1d6799a1b765c3c8bc0b675b1a1547d

I simply added stuff to it to make it work with some of Twitter's weird new functionality. 

Usage is to navigate to your "Likes" tab in your browser and then just copy and paste the script into your dev console (press F12)

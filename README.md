Credit for the main function of unliking posts goes to: https://gist.github.com/aymericbeaumet/d1d6799a1b765c3c8bc0b675b1a1547d

I simply added stuff to it to make it work with some of Twitter's weird new functionlity. 

Usage is to navigate to your "Likes" tab in your browser and then just copy and paste the script into your dev console (press F12)
